Added the galaga.py file. File must be run with python3 and you must download the 
used libraries. Better to run in fullscreen mode so you can see entire window better.
File is based on youtude video series by christian thompson titled "space invaders"

Decided turtle probably isnt the best library to use. Pygame is much better and easier
to learn. Added new files and images directory. Add all images you use to the images directory.
The game is now in the file called galagapg.py. I found a tutorial on youtube that was helpful.
A link to the start of the youtube series is https://youtu.be/nGufy7weyGY. I think there is like 10 videos in the series
It helped in learning pygame and based my code on what I found there. I will continue working with the ships,
including their movement and collisions. More enemy classes will also be made for levels later on.
If someone wants to start designing a menu/gui for starting the game, pausing the game and a quit menu or something
that would help us a lot. Run with python3 galagapg.py, you must install pygame.
